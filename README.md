# Parking_Management_System_OOPS
The topic of this project is Parking Management System. The principal objective of this model is to build a secure, efficient, automatic, and user-friendly parking system. I've used the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the programming language C++, making full use of classes and objects, constructors, destructors, inheritance, and some basic concepts of file handling. The whole program is menu-driven that allows the vehicle owner to park the vehicle or exit the organization. To make the functioning more secure, it inputs every detail of any automobile entering the organization while providing an E-slip to the vehicle owner for the same.
